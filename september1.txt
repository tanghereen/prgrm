Variables 
include 4 parts:

	1. Declaration keyword 
		(var, let, or const)

	2. Identifier 
		(variable name) - a unique name to refer to the variable

	3. Assignment operator 
		(=)

	4. Initial value 
		(optional but recommended)


Keywords


	var
	used in older browsers. Valid, but should avoid use.

	let
	used in modern browsers to declare variables whose value can change. 

				Use ...
	const
	used with arrays or when the value held should not change.

Variable Names

	The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
		- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
		- Names must begin with a letter
		- Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
		- Names are case-sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
		- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

The Assignment Operator

	In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.

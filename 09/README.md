# Section 9 - JavaScript Objects

## Overview

JavaScript objects allow related attributes to be grouped together and are essential to advanced programs. 
All that and they are easy to understand.

## JavaScript Objects

See variables from Section 2. 

If you understand objects, you understand JavaScript. In JavaScript, almost "everything" is an object. All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.

- Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
- Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
- Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
- Dates are always objects
- Maths are always objects
- Regular expressions are always objects
- Arrays are always objects
- Functions are always objects
- Objects are always objects

All JavaScript values, except primitives, are objects.                

### Primitives

A primitive value is a value that has no properties or methods. A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value. JavaScript defines 5 types of primitive data types:

- string
- number
- boolean
- null
- undefined

Primitive values are immutable (they are hardcoded and therefore cannot be changed).

> if `x = 3.14`, you can change the value of `x`. But you cannot change the value of `3.14`.

| Value | Type | Comment                       |
|---|---|-------------------------------|
| "Hello" | string | "Hello" is always "Hello"     |
| 3.14 | number | 3.14 is always 3.14           |
| true | boolean | true is always true           |
| false | boolean | false is always false         |
| null | null (object) | null is always null           |
| undefined | undefined | undefined is always undefined |

### Objects as Variables

JavaScript variables can contain single values:

```
let person = "John Doe";
```

JavaScript variables can also contain many values. Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

Object values are written as `name : value` pairs (name and value separated by a colon). It is a common practice to declare objects with the `const` keyword.

```
const person = {
    firstName:"John", 
    lastName:"Doe", 
    age:50, 
    eyeColor:"blue"
};
```

This example creates an empty JavaScript object, and then adds 4 properties:
    
```
const person = {};
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = "blue";
```

### JavaScript Objects are Mutable

Objects are mutable: They are addressed by reference, not by value.

If `person` is an object, the following statement will not create a copy of `person`:

```
const x = person;  // Will not create a copy of person.
```

The object `x` is not a copy of person. It **is** `person`. Both `x` and `person` are the same object.

Any changes to `x` will also change `person`, because `x` and `person` are the same object.
                                                                      
```
const person = {
  firstName:"John",
  lastName:"Doe",
  age:50, eyeColor:"blue"
}

const x = person;
x.age = 10;      // Will change both x.age and person.age
```
  
## Object Properties

Properties are the most important part of any JavaScript object.

Properties are the values associated with a JavaScript object.

A JavaScript object is a collection of unordered properties.

Properties can usually be changed, added, and deleted, but some are read only.

The syntax for accessing the property of an object is:

```
objectName.property      // person.age
```

or

```
objectName["property"]   // person["age"]
```

### Nested Objects

Values in an object can be another object:
                                
```
myObj = {
  name:"John",
  age:30,
  cars: {
    car1:"Ford",
    car2:"BMW",
    car3:"Fiat"
  }
}
```

You can access nested objects using the dot notation or the bracket notation:

```
myObj.cars.car2;
```

### Nested Arrays and Objects

Values in objects can be arrays, and values in arrays can be objects:

```
const myObj = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  cars: [
    {name:"Ford", models:["Fiesta", "Focus", "Mustang"]},
    {name:"BMW", models:["320", "X3", "X5"]},
    {name:"Fiat", models:["500", "Panda"]}
  ]
}
```

To access arrays inside arrays, use a for-in loop for each array:

```
for (let i in myObj.cars) {
  x += "<h1>" + myObj.cars[i].name + "</h1>";
  for (let j in myObj.cars[i].models) {
    x += myObj.cars[i].models[j];
  }
}
```

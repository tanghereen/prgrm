        Prime Number Checker

        A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that is only divisible by 1 and itself.
        For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 are the first few prime numbers. Write a JavaScript program that
        will accept a single numeric value and determine if it is a prime number or not. For cases
        when the number is not a prime number include all divisors. 

        Example #1:
        Input: 5
        Output: 5 is a prime number :)

        Example #2:
        Input: 6
        Output: 6 is not a prime number :(
                6 is divisible by 2,3

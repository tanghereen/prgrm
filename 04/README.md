# Section 4 - Arrays and Loops

## Learning Outcomes
Arrays and loops are an essential constructs in the majority of programing languages. The ability to define a list of values and iterate over the list performing operations is a critical skill to master.
- **Arrays** - syntax, functions, sorting, conversions
- **Loops** - `for` and `while` loops

## Arrays

An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:

```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
```

### Why Use an Array?

If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

```javascript
let car1 = "Saab";
let car2 = "Volvo";
let car3 = "BMW";
```

However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?

The solution is an array!

An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.       

### Creating an Array

These are the three most common ways to create arrays for use in JavaScript programs.

#### 1) Array Literal

Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array. It is a common practice to declare arrays using square brackets `[` and `]`.

```javascript
Syntax:

const array_name = [item1, item2, ...];    
```
```javascript
Example:

const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
```

> Note the use of the `const` keyword which is recommended when declaring arrays.

#### 2) Using the JavaScript Keyword `new`

The following example also creates an Array, and assigns values to it:

```javascript
const cars = new Array("Saab", "Volvo", "BMW");
```

#### 3) Using `split()` with a String of values

A string can be converted to an array with the `split()` method:

```javascript
Syntax:

string.split(separator, limit)
```

| Parameter | Description                                                             |
|---|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| separator | *Optional*. The character (or regular expression) to use for splitting. |
| limit | *Optional*. An integer that limits the number of splits.                                                        |

```javascript
let input = "Saab,Volvo,BMW";
const cars = input.split(",");
```

`split()` can be applied to string literals

```javascript
const cars = "Saab Volvo BMW".split(" ");
```

`split()` can also be applied to the result of other functions that return strings

```javascript
const cars = prompt("Enter cars:", "Saab|Volvo|BMW").split("|");
```

## Array Functions

### `length`

Arrays have an attribute called length which is the number of elements in the array.

```javascript
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
let carCount = cars.length;    // carCount is 3
```

### `sort()`

The `sort()` method sorts an array alphabetically:

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.sort();
```

## Array Indexes

Values in an array can be accessed by their index value. Indexes start with zero `0`.


| Banana | Orange | Apple | Mango |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| 0      | 1      | 2     | 3     |

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
```  

In this example, the value of `fruits[0]` is `Banana` and `fruits[3]` is `Mango`.

> **Note**: To access the last element in an array by index use `length-1`.  
>
> In the example above `fruits.length` is `4` and the index of the last element is `3`, so `fruits.length-1` can be used to access the last element by index.


### `push()` and `pop()` Elements

When you work with arrays, it is easy to add and remove elements.

This is what popping and pushing is:

- `Pop()` -  remove items from an array
- `Push()` - add items to an array

The `pop()` method removes the last element from an array:

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.pop();
```

The `pop()` method returns the value that was "popped out":

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let fruit = fruits.pop();  // The value of fruit is 'Mango'
```

The `push()` method adds a new element to an array (at the end):

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.push("Kiwi");
```

The `push()` method returns the new array length:

```javascript
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
let length = fruits.push("Kiwi");  // The value of length is 5
```

## Loops

Loops can execute a block of code a number of times. Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

### `for` loop

The `for` loop has the following syntax:

```javascript
Syntax:

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

- **"Initialization"** *(Statement 1)*: executed ***one time*** before the execution of the code block.
- **"Conditional check"** *(Statement 2)*: executed ***zero to many times*** defines the condition for executing the code block.
- **"Increment"** *(Statement 3)*: is executed ***every time*** after the code block has been executed.

```javascript
Example:

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}
```

From the example above, you can read:

- **Statement 1** sets a variable before the loop starts (`let i = 0`).
- **Statement 2** defines the condition for the loop to run (`i` must be less than 5).
- **Statement 3** increases a value (`i++`) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.

### `while` loop

The `while` loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is `true`.

```javascript
Syntax:

while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```

In the following example, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (`i`) is less than 10:

```javascript
while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
```

> **Note**: a `for` loop can be used when the number of elements are known and `while` loops is used when the number of elements or iterations is not known. In many cases `for` loops and `while` loops can be used interchangeably.
